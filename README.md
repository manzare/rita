playground to learn Git, bit of JavaScript and how front-end things work in order to manage some simple Iterate-related things myself. 
Current goal: creating a one-picture-rebus for Gamification-frokostseminar. If people solve it they will get a free code to the workshop.
Further plan with this rebus:
 - include a randomcode generator to give a "promocode" for those who solve it
 - create a solution that makes the answer hidden so people cant see it from the source.
 - make the page look NICER :)
 - use a more Iterate-related rebus
Coming soon.
